In this lecture, we explored the dynamics of frontend and backend development and their interplay. Frontend interfaces connect with the backend, which in turn interfaces with databases. Notably, multiple backends and servers can coexist within a system.

Specifically, we delved into React for frontend development, understanding its role in crafting user interfaces. On the backend side, our focus was on Node.js and Express, equipping us to build robust server-side applications. 
For database management, MongoDB was our subject of study, offering flexibility and scalability for data storage needs.
